# File Organiser

This program organises all files in a directory into different directories based on their file extensions. I built this as a personal project during my first year of Engineering.


## Installation

To install the program, run the following command:

```
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

## TODO

* Test this program on operating systems other than Windows 11 using GitHub Actions.
* Add docs, as required.
