# File Organiser

This program organises all files in a directory into different directories based on their file extensions. I built this as a personal project during my first year of Engineering.

## NOTICE
 
This program has only been tested on Windows 11. 

## TODO

* Test this program on operating systems other than Windows 11.
* Add docs, __init__.py, as required.
* Add try and excepts for import statements. If ModuleNotFound exception, then install the module; Can also add a workaround instead. Use the requirements.txt file.
* Make the program as general as possible.
