# File Organiser

This program organises all files in a directory into different directories based on their file extensions. I built this as a personal project during my first year of Engineering.

## NOTICE
 
This program has only been tested on Windows 11. 

## TODO

* Test this program on operating systems other than Windows 11.
* Add try and excepts for import statements. If ModuleNotFound exception, then do a pip install of the module. Use the requirements.txt file.

## Status

I am still working on adding some new nice features, but the basic idea is already available.
